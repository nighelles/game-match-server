This is the server that will allow game matching and communication between users.

The server keeps track of gamerequest objects in an sql database, these objects have the following properties:
id 		- in order of creation.
name 		- name of player who is requesting the match
game		- name of the activity that the request is for
longitude	- Longitude of creating user
latitude	- Latitude of creating user
tolerance	- How many miles away can joining users be 
available - count of how many player spots are still open in the "game"

The server also tracks all usernames that have been registered:
username	- should be obvious
id		- assigned in order of creation


##### COMMANDS #####

The server will respond to the following commands on port 1234
0:username:			=> Recognize user in user database
				=> This command is necessariy before the server will present you with matches

1:Activity:Longitude:Latitude:Tolerance:available:
				=> Create game request

2:DATA				=> send a block of data to each game client in our match

3:username			=> Request creation of a username

4:				=> Disconnect from match

##### RESPONSES #####

The server will respond with a message who's first byte corresponds to the notification it is sending.
ERRORCODE 	= 0
IDENTIFYUSEROK 	= 1
IDENTITYUSERFAIL= 2
NEWUSEROK	= 3
NEWUSERFAIL	= 4	(This message will be sent if the username is taken)
REQUESTWAIT	= 5 	(The server has received your request, but is still matching players)
REQUESTFOUND	= 6	(The server has found a player for your request, added to match)
DATACODE	= 7	(The rest of the message bytes contain data from a client)
LEFTCODE	= 8	(A player has left the match)

MATCHSTART	= 9	(All requested players for this match have been found/added)
			(The server will delete the request)




Things to Fix:
- (FIXED) Allow matching between more than 2 people
- (FIXED, sorta) Match based on actual distance rather than long/lat difference.
- Change connection objects to only store the transport, rather than the whole connection.
- Decide on an actual Licence.
