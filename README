This is the server that will allow game matching and communication between users.

The server keeps track of gamerequest objects in an sql database, these objects have the following properties:
id 		- in order of creation.
name 		- name of player who is requesting the match
game		- name of the activity that the request is for
longitude	- Longitude of creating user
latitude	- Latitude of creating user
tolerance	- How many miles away can joining users be 
available	- count of how many player spots are still open in the "game"
players		- How many players total do we want

The server also tracks all usernames that have been registered:
username	- should be obvious
id		- assigned in order of creation

Server communications protocalls are different with new node/websockets implementation, I'll write up the standards in a bit.
